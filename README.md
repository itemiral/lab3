The code given has different prefetchers that are being used in different conditions.  We added the Best Offset Prefetcher Implementation inside the pref_stream.h and .c files, because we had some bugs related to the Makefile.

We are currently in the process of updating dcache_stage.c and dcache_stage.h files in order for BOP to be selected and see the differences it makes on latency and cache misses/hits
